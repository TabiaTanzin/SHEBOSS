		There is no limit to what we, as women can accomplish. 
		So it is the duty of every woman to support each other,
		empower each other, and help each other rise. At this time of the crisis, 
		I believe that our small endeavour could support other women and help everyone stay safe and happy at their homes,
		while help them buy things they need.

</p>
<p class="pra">
I designed a website through which women can find women owned enterprises easily, 
connect new emerging enterprises with the buyers, 
by registering in our site, and help them find new products. 
So, any women willing to start their business career could register at our site, 
sell their products, staying safe and happy at home. 
And every man or woman could purchase products they desire, 
staying safe and happy at home as well.I believe in the happiness, satisfaction and comfort of people.
