# SHEBOSS
## Inspiration
There is no limit to what we, as women can accomplish. So it is the duty of every woman to support each other, empower each other, and help each other rise. At this time of the crisis, we believe that our small endeavour could support other women and help everyone stay safe and happy at their homes, while help them buy things they need.

## What it does
She boss is a website, through which we can find women owned enterprises easily, connect new emerging enterprises with the buyers, by registering in our site, and help them find new products. So, any woman willing to start their business career could register at our site, sell their products, staying safe and happy at home. And every man or woman could purchase products what they desire, staying safe and happy at home as well. We believe in the happiness, satisfaction and comfort of people.

## How I built it
Our website She Boss, is built on the Flask framework and hosted on Heroku servers.The entire code has been developed using Python programming language. The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Challenges I ran into
Database crashing, hard to find business database.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are proud of learning new skills, host a website, and could support women and connect people to purchase and sell business products and home made products as well, staying safe and happy at home, in the way we could.

## What I learned
We learnt a lot new Front end and Backend development tools. Learnt how to handle different crashing errors. And 40% of businesses in US are women owned, and the statistics is rising, which we can be proud of.
